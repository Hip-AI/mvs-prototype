# Multimodal Validity System (MVS) – Feasibility Prototype

**HipAI** is developing the Multimodal Validity System (MVS), an AI-based framework that enhances neuropsychological and behavioral assessments by detecting patterns of performance validity using real-time multimodal data fusion.

This prototype explores the feasibility of MVS using publicly available datasets containing deception, cognitive workload, and emotional effort signals.

## Project Goals

- Prototype multimodal fusion architecture (video, audio, text)
- Evaluate baseline models using proxy datasets (DDPM, MOCAS, Bag-of-Lies)
- Validate feasibility of performance/effort classification
- Identify limitations in alignment, fusion, and interpretability
